and other supporting data in sheets and JSONs used in the code for cleaning and analysis.

How to run the code:
* Make a shortcut of the shared folder in google drive.
* Mount the drive(check for the folder you made a shortcut of in step 1) Run the data_prep notebook first that will clean the data and save a CSV on which EDA is performed . (this CSV is already present in the folder for reference)
